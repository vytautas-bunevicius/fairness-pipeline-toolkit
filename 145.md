# Part 5: Fairness Pipeline Development Toolkit

## 1. Introduction

Sprint 4A has equipped you with the individual code components for operationalizing fairness. You created a **Measurement Module** for bias detection, a **Pipeline Module** for data debiasing, and a **Training Module** for fair model development. Now, you will integrate them. This final project transforms your collection of modules into a single, cohesive toolkit that orchestrates fairness across the pre-deployment ML lifecycle.

## 2. Context

Your team at **FairML Consulting** has delivered successful modules to your client. Each solved a specific problem, yet a new, higher-level challenge emerged during deployment.

"We have great modules," the data science lead told you, "but they aren't enough to ensure consistency at scale. We need a unified blueprint, an orchestration layer that guarantees standardization when implementing these tools. You won't be there to advise every team at every step, unlike with the pilot."

She showed you their architecture diagram: powerful modules sitting in isolation. The problem was clear: components without coordination might create chaos if scaled throughout the organization.

Individual modules solve point problems; an integrated toolkit transforms an organization's entire approach to AI development. You will build the final integration layer—the configuration systems, pipeline orchestrators, and validation frameworks that make fairness systematic, reproducible, and scalable.

## 3. Objectives

By completing this project, you will practice how to:

- Design an end-to-end pipeline that orchestrates selected components from your measurement, data, and training modules.
- Create a declarative configuration file that defines a complete fairness workflow.
- Integrate a fairness pipeline with standard MLOps tooling by logging key artifacts and metrics to MLflow.
- Implement baseline and final validation steps to measure the impact of a fairness intervention.
- Produce clear documentation for an integrated ML system, including an architecture diagram.

## 4. Requirements

Your final **Fairness Pipeline Development Toolkit** will be an integrated system that automates one complete, fair machine learning workflow.

1. **A Central Configuration File.** You must create a `config.yml` file that defines the behavior of a single, end-to-end pipeline. This file should allow a user to specify:

   - At least one pre-processing transformer to apply from your `PipelineModule` (e.g., `DisparateImpactRemover`).
   - At least one fairness-aware training method to use from your `TrainingModule` (e.g., the `ReductionsWrapper`).
   - The primary fairness metric to measure (e.g., `demographic_parity_difference`) and a final validation threshold.

2. **A Pipeline Orchestrator Script.** You must build a main Python script (`run_pipeline.py`) that acts as the orchestrator.

   - It must parse the `config.yml` file to get the pipeline definition.
   - It must sequentially call the necessary components from your modules to execute the defined workflow.

3. **A Defined Module Integration Logic.** The orchestrator script must manage the data flow and interactions between your modules in a clear, three-step sequence:

   - **Step 1 (Baseline Measurement):** Use your `MeasurementModule` to audit the raw input data and print a baseline fairness report to the console.
   - **Step 2 (Transform Data and Train Model):** Apply the single data transformer specified in the config, then train the model using the single fair training method specified in the config.
   - **Step 3 (Final Validation):** Use your `MeasurementModule` again to evaluate the final trained model and print a "report card" comparing the final fairness score to the baseline.

4. **Focused MLflow Integration.** Your orchestrator must log the key results of the pipeline run to MLflow for traceability.

   - Log the primary performance metric (e.g., `accuracy`) and the primary fairness metric (e.g., `demographic_parity_difference`) so they are viewable in the MLflow UI.
   - Log the final trained model object as an artifact.
   - Log the `config.yml` file used for the run as an artifact.

5. **A Complete End-to-End Example.** Your submission must include a demonstration notebook (`demo.ipynb`) that clearly explains and executes your `run_pipeline.py` script for one complete use case defined in your `config.yml`.
6. **Clear Documentation.** Your repository's `README.md` must serve as the user manual.

   - It must include an **architecture diagram** that visually explains the data flow between the three integrated modules.
   - It must provide a guide on how to structure the `config.yml` file.

## 5. Evaluation Criteria

Your project will be evaluated on the successful integration and orchestration of your modules into a single, functional pipeline.

1. **Integration and Orchestration:** Does the `run_pipeline.py` script correctly parse the config and execute the three-step workflow using the specified modules?
2. **Configuration System:** Does the `config.yml` file effectively control the behavior of the pipeline?
3. **MLOps Integration:** Are the specified metrics and artifacts correctly logged to MLflow?
4. **Documentation and Clarity:** Is the documentation, including the architecture diagram, clear enough for a new user to understand and run the project?

## 6. Project Review

During your project review, you will present the **Fairness Pipeline Development Toolkit** as if you were presenting the final, complete product to your client at FairML Consulting. Your presentation should be a compelling demonstration of a cohesive, production-ready solution.

- **Problem Statement:** Reiterate the challenge of inconsistent, ad-hoc fairness work and explain how an integrated toolkit provides the solution.
- **Toolkit Overview:** Present your architecture diagram and walk through how the modules are orchestrated to create an end-to-end pre-deployment pipeline.
- **Practical Demonstration:** Showcase your implemented use case. Run the orchestrator script and walk through the generated MLflow experiment, highlighting the logged artifacts and metrics. Emphasize how the `config.yml` allows for a declarative and reproducible workflow.
- **Key Insights:** Discuss what you learned about the complexities of integrating fairness components and how different fairness strategies impact final outcomes.

Be prepared to discuss how your toolkit balances scientific rigor with usability and how it can be adapted for different AI applications and industries. This is your opportunity to demonstrate mastery over the practical fairness lifecycle.
